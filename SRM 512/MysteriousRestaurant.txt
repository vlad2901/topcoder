PROBLEM STATEMENT
A mysterious new restaurant is open in the city for only N days. Happy to hear that, Ash and Elsh would like to have lunch at the restaurant on as many days as possible.

The restaurant sells M types of dishes. Being a mysterious restaurant, it has mysterious rules for the customers:


They can only buy one single dish per day.
If they buy a dish of type j on the i-th day, then on the same day next week, i.e., on the (i+7)-th day, they can only buy a dish of type j.
If they don't buy any dishes on any day, then they can't buy any dishes again from the restaurant.


Mysteriously, the price of each type of dish varies every day. You are given a vector <string> prices consisting of N elements, each containing M characters. prices[i][j] represents the price of the j-th type of dish on the i-th day, encoded as follows:


'0' - '9': denotes the price of 0 - 9 dollars.
'A' - 'Z': denotes the price of 10 - 35 dollars.
'a' - 'z': denotes the price of 36 - 61 dollars.


Ash and Elsh have only budget dollars allocated for having lunch in the restaurant. Return the maximum number of days they could have lunch in the restaurant.
