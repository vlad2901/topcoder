PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a simple paragraph containing a number of sentences, the original person who wrote the paragraph was in a rush and used only lower case letters ('a'-'z') for the words in the paragraph and did not use any punctuation other than a period to separate sentences. Your task is to fix the capitalization in the paragraph, the objective is to make it so every sentence in the paragraph begins with a capital (upper case) letter ('A'-'Z').

The paragraph is formatted as one or more sentences separated by single space (' ') characters. Each sentence consists of one or more words separated by single space (' ') characters. The last word in a sentence is always immediately followed by a single dot ('.') character. Each word is a non-empty string containing only lower case letters ('a'-'z'). As an example, consider the following paragraph (quotes for clarity):


"this is merely an example. be careful. this is a new sentence."

The result of your program must then be as follows:


"This is merely an example. Be careful. This is a new sentence."
