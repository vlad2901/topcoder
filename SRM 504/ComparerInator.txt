PROBLEM STATEMENT
Comparer-inator is a very simple language that is specialized in comparisons. It takes an expression and returns the result. There are only two kinds of expressions: a variable name or a tertiary operator inspired by C syntax (which is also used in many languages like Java, C++, and C#). We are interested to use this language to process two vector <int>s, A and B to generate the vector <int> wanted as a result. We have previously found that there are four candidate programs that could be an optimal way to solve the issue we have. Each of the programs takes two arguments a and b.

"a" : This program will return the given argument a.
"b" : This program will return the given argument b.
"a<b?a:b" : If a is less than b, the program will return a, else it will return b.
"a<b?b:a" : If a is less than b, the program will return b, else it will return a.


Given vector <int> A, B and wanted find the shortest of the four candidate programs that, for every index i, will return wanted[i] after being provided a=A[i] and b=B[i] as arguments. Return the length of the shortest program. If no candidate program can do the required job, return -1 instead.

DEFINITION
Class:ComparerInator
Method:makeProgram
Parameters:vector <int>, vector <int>, vector <int>
Returns:int
Method signature:int makeProgram(vector <int> A, vector <int> B, vector <int> wanted)


CONSTRAINTS
-A will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-B and wanted will each contain the same number of elements as A.
-Each element of A, B and wanted will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{1}
{2}
{2}

Returns: 1

"b" and "a<b?b:a" (quotes for clarity) are the two programs that will return 2 after being given a=1, b=2 as arguments. "b" is the shortest of them.


1)
{1,3}
{2,1}
{2,3}

Returns: 7

"a<b?b:a" is the only program that will return 2 after being provided a=1, b=2 and will also
return 3 after being provided a=3, b=1.

2)
{1,3,5}
{2,1,7}
{2,3,5}

Returns: -1

None of the four programs can do the job correctly.

3)
{1,3,5}
{2,1,7}
{1,3,5}

Returns: 1



4)
{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}
{5,4,7,8,3,1,1,2,3,4,6}
{1,2,3,4,3,1,1,2,3,4,6}

Returns: 7



5)
{1,5,6,7,8}
{1,5,6,7,8}
{1,5,6,7,8}

Returns: 1

"a", "b", "a<b?a:b" and "a<b?b:a" are all valid programs that will give the wanted result. "a" and "b" are the shortest.
