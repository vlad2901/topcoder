PROBLEM STATEMENT
N rabbits (numbered 0 through N - 1) are going to work together at the new TopCoder office in Rabbitland. 

Each pair of rabbits will make a certain profit when they work together. 
The efficiency of the group of rabbits is defined as follows: 
Let P be the sum of profits from all pairs of rabbits, and Q be the number of pairs of rabbits. 
Then the efficiency is the real number P / Q. 

You are given a vector <string> profit, 
the j-th character of the i-th element of which represents the profit from the fact that rabbits i and j work together. 
The characters '0', '1', ..., '9' represent the values 0, 1, ..., 9, respectively. 
Compute and return the efficiency of this TopCoder office. 


DEFINITION
Class:WorkingRabbits
Method:getEfficiency
Parameters:vector <string>
Returns:double
Method signature:double getEfficiency(vector <string> profit)


NOTES
-The returned value must have an absolute or relative error less than 1e-9. 


CONSTRAINTS
-profit will contain between 2 and 50 elements, inclusive. 
-Each element of profit will contain exactly N characters, where N is the number of elements in profit. 
-Each character in each element of profit will be a digit ('0' - '9'). 
-For each index i and j, the i-th character of the j-th element of profit will be equal to the j-th character of the i-th element of profit. 
-For each index i, the i-th character of the i-th element of profit will be '0'. 


EXAMPLES

0)
{ "071", 
  "702", 
  "120" }


Returns: 3.3333333333333335

There are three pairs of rabbits: 

	rabbit 0 and rabbit 1 (profit 7)
	rabbit 0 and rabbit 2 (profit 1)
	rabbit 1 and rabbit 2 (profit 2)

So P = 7 + 1 + 2, Q = 3, and the efficiency is P / Q = 10/3.
